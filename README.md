* Deploy a web application to Azure. You can write this web application, or it can be an open-source project.
* Deploy the web application as a Docker Container.
* Deploy the Docker Container using Kubernetes.
* Any supporting infrastructure should be configured and deployed as code (e.g., Terraform, ARM)
* Bonus points for any build and deployment automation in deploying the web application.
* Bonus points for demonstrating the ability to deploy, destroy, and re-deploy the web application and any supporting infrastructure.
* Include all code and artifacts you create to complete this exercise within this repository for review.
